# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

## New Computer Checklist (OSX Edition)

1. Download Xcode from the Mac App Store.
2. Sob gently into a pillow, and restart the stuck Xcode installation.
3. Accept the XCode licence: `sudo xcodebuild -license`
4. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).
5. Install stuff from the Brewfile: `brew bundle`
6. Run `brew linkapps` to symlink MacVim into the `/Applications` directory.
